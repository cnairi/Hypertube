# HYPERTUBE | HYPERTUBE & CHILL

Hypertube is a Netflix-like app realized in Node.js and React.js along with Redux, using Express Framework and a Mongo database. It is the third and last project before our first internship at 42. It is a non-profit, non-commercial streaming app. We've used styled-components and material-ui to style our app. Our website is fully responsive.

We were a group of 3 people working 1 month and a half on it, @dcirlig, @gphilips and I.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any question!
